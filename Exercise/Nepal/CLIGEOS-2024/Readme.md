# End to end mapping exercise


## Context : 

In April of 2024 , We have performed end to end mapping exercise with the motive of demonstrating how using all opensource softwares we can carry out full mapping scenario to support climate change objective . E2E exercise was done in CLImbing for [CLImate GEOspatial School CLIGEOS-2024](https://cligeos2024.conscor.com/)  which was held in 
Annapurna-3, Lumle - Pokhara, NEPAL Directorate of Agricultural Research, Gandaki Province. Jointly organized by  CENTER FOR SPACE SCIENCE AND GEOMATICS STUDIES (CSSGS) PASHCHIMANCHAL CAMPUS, INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING, TRIBHUVAN UNIVERSITY, Nepal, UNIVERSITAâ€™ DEGLI STUDI DI UDINE, Italy and  LJ UNIVERSITY, India.
