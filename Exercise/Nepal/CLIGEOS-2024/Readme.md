# End to end mapping exercise


## Context : 

In April of 2024 , We have performed end to end mapping exercise with the motive of demonstrating how using all opensource softwares we can carry out full mapping scenario to support climate change objective . E2E exercise was done in CLImbing for [CLImate GEOspatial School CLIGEOS-2024](https://cligeos2024.conscor.com/)  which was held in 
Annapurna-3, Lumle - Pokhara, NEPAL Directorate of Agricultural Research, Gandaki Province. Jointly organized by  CENTER FOR SPACE SCIENCE AND GEOMATICS STUDIES (CSSGS) PASHCHIMANCHAL CAMPUS, INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING, TRIBHUVAN UNIVERSITY, Nepal, UNIVERSITAâ€™ DEGLI STUDI DI UDINE, Italy and  LJ UNIVERSITY, India.

## Steps Performed : 

1) Get Area of Interest : 

Area of interest has been created with the local knowleadge and modified in OpenStreetMap 
```osm_id=742793744```

2 ) Download Area of interest from OpenStreetMap 

We have used rawdata api to download our AOI 

https://api-prod.raw-data.hotosm.org/v1/osm_id/?osm_id=742793744

3 ) Flight Plan :

5 ) Drone Data Processing 

We used OpenDroneMap to Process the collected Drone image . We have added NIR ( Near Infrared Band ) too as we had multispectral drone and our testing area is agriculture research center. TBD ATTACH SCREENSHOT HERE

6 ) Upload geotiff to OpenAerial Map 

Processed Orthophoto was uploaded to OpenAerialMap . Find the image [here] (https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/-18.632,18.478999999999985,3/latest/6614a992c055e600014ac552?_k=bo3rix)

7) Create Tasking Manager Project 
For our exercise we created our tasking manager project in [dev server](https://tasks-dev.hotosm.org/projects/5) using the [TMS](https://tiles.openaerialmap.org/6614a755c055e600014ac550/0/6614a755c055e600014ac551/{z}/{x}/{y}) that we got for our image from OpenAerialMap. It is done in the morning after image was uploaded so that all participant can map in the afternoon.

8) Map and Validate 
Total 29 People contributed and validated each other's Work . We made sure remote mapping is up to date in the area . We spent Approx 3 Hour for remote mapping.
